link to grab missing images is 
https://gameinfo.albiononline.com/api/gameinfo/items/T4_ARTEFACT_ARMOR_CLOTH_KEEPER.png
you would replace the item name with the item you are looking for. so if you needed T6_ORE_LEVEL3@3
the link youd go to is https://gameinfo.albiononline.com/api/gameinfo/items/T6_ORE_LEVEL3@3.png
could possible just pull these from the web instead of locally hosted not sure performance wise since their site seems sluggish.

my code is very sloppy as I do not primarily work with js
